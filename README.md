# frt - Fl√∂ssie's ready (FreeRTOS) threading

frt is an object-oriented wrapper around FreeRTOS tasks, queues, mutexes, and semaphores. It provides the basic tools for a clean multithreading approach based on the [Arduino_FreeRTOS_Library](https://github.com/feilipu/Arduino_FreeRTOS_Library) with focus on static allocation, so you know your SRAM demands at compile time.

This will compile just fine with the stock [Arduino_FreeRTOS_Library](https://github.com/feilipu/Arduino_FreeRTOS_Library), but if you want the advantages of static allocation you are welcome to try my [`minimal-static`](https://github.com/Floessie/Arduino_FreeRTOS_Library/tree/minimal-static) branch with frt.

**This is work in progress, so take it with a grain of salt...**

## Examples

There's a single example called [`Blink_AnalogRead.ino`](https://github.com/Floessie/frt/blob/master/examples/Blink_AnalogRead/Blink_AnalogRead.ino) for now. [`frt.h`](https://github.com/Floessie/frt/blob/master/src/frt.h) itself isn't that big and magical as well, so take it as a reference until I've spent some more time on documentation.

## API

The whole API resides in the `frt` namespace.

### Task

A task (or thread in other OSes) is the thing that does the work. It's like your common `loop()` workhorse, but with a real OS you can have many of those `loop()` functions running concurrently. A single task is basically implemented like so:

```c++
class MyFirstTask :
    public frt::Task<MyFirstTask>
{
public:
    bool run()
    {
        // Do something meaningful here...

        return true;
    }
};
```

The repetition of `MyFirstTask` in `frt::Task<MyFirstTask>` is due to [static dispatch per CRTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern#Static_polymorphism), a commonly used pattern that saves code and precious RAM. Think of `run()` as your previously used `loop()` function with an additional return value, with which you can signal if you want to be called again or not. If you would return `false` in the example above, `run()` would only be called once.

Things you can only do inside your task class:
* `yield()`: If there's another task with the same or higher priority, switch over to it voluntarily.
* `msleep(milliseconds)`: Sleep for some milliseconds. This suspends the task so that others can run.
  - Be aware that there's a [timer granularity](https://github.com/feilipu/Arduino_FreeRTOS_Library#general) of usually 15 milliseconds. So giving for example `14` here won't sleep but simply yield, and giving `20` will only sleep for 15 milliseconds. See the next function to work-around this.
* `msleep(milliseconds, remainder)`: Sleep for some milliseconds and store the remaining milliseconds in `remainder`. This will result in some jitter but won't loose milliseconds to the timer granularity.
* `wait()`: Wait for a [*direct to task notification*](https://www.freertos.org/RTOS_Task_Notification_As_Binary_Semaphore.html). Some other task must call `post()` to wake you up again.
* `wait(milliseconds)`: Same as above, but with a timeout. Returns `true` if someone `post()`ed you, or `false` on timeout.
* `wait(milliseconds, remainder)`: Same as above but with the `remainder` mechanism on timeout.

Functions that can be called from outside:
* `start(priority)`: Start the task with a certain priority (higher number = higher priority).
  - Note that there's a limited number of available priorities. Stock Arduino_FreeRTOS_Library supports 0-3, my [`minimal-static`](https://github.com/Floessie/Arduino_FreeRTOS_Library/tree/minimal-static) branch 0-7.
  - The idle task that executes `loop()` has priority 0.
* `stop()`: Stops the task.
  - If you want to stop from within your task, return `false` from `run()`. Don't call `stop()`!
* `isRunning()`: Returns true if the task is started.
* `getUsedStackSize()`: Each task has a buffer that is used for storing function local variables and return addresses. This function lets you determine the maximum number of bytes used (so far).
  - Only valid while the task is running.
  - Interrupts are also served in a task's context, so the result may vary. Don't be too conservative.
* `post()`: Wake task via *direct to task notification*.
* `preparePostFromInterrupt()`: When posting from an interrupt, this function must be called when entering the ISR.
* `postFromInterrupt()`: Like `post()` but from inside an ISR.
* `finalizePostFromInterrupt()`: This function must be called last in the ISR whether you called `postFromInterrupt()` or not.
